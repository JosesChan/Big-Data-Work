# Big Data Work
Python using Anaconda for big data analytics. Uses dataframes from numpy, pandas and a Spark RDD to store data. Utilises an extract-transform-load pipeline to select features which are to be transformed using normalisation or a scaler and are then loaded in a machine learning model. Key information gathered is presented through seaborn and matplotlib figures as well as outputted to the console.
